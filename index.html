				<p>
					Lynbrook Piano Club is a community of piano enthusiasts who enjoy both listening to and performing piano.

				<h2>
					Where: Room 002 (Dr. Rocklin's Room) <br>
					When: Wednesdays at lunch
				</h2>
				<p>
					Piano Club has weekly meetings on Wednesdays at lunch in Dr. Rocklin's Room (002). Regular meetings usually consist of either a presentation or an activity on something in the piano world (artist presentation or music theory practice). In addition to regular meetings, there are also performance meetings, where members meet in the choir room to listen to their fellow members perform their piano pieces. After a performance, the performer can receive help on how to improve from the officers or other memberes.
