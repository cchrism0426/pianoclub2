						What Our Club is About
					</h1>
					<p>
						Lynbrook Piano Club is community of piano enthusiasts who enjoy both listening to and performing piano. We strive to help our members improve their piano proficiency as well as their musicality in general. Moreover, there are volunteer opportunities to help members improve their piano abilities while earning service hours. In the past, members have often gone to nursing homes to perform to the seniors.

					</h2>
					<p>
						Piano Club has weekly meetings on Wednesdays at lunch in Dr. Rocklin's Room (002). Regular meetings usually consist of either a presentation or an activity on something in the piano world (artist presentation or music theory practice). In addition to regular meetings, there are also performance meetings, where members meet in the choir room to listen to their fellow members perform their piano pieces. After a performance, the performer can receive help on how to improve from the officers or other memberes.
